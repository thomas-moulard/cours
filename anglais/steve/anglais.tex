\maketitle

I'm working at the LRDE on the Vauncanson project since
2006. Vaucanson is a framework dedicated to the manipulation of finite
state machines. The goal of this project is to attain two objectives:
genericity and performance. Genericity so that Vaucanson can be use
on a wide variety of problems. Performance so that Vaucanson can be
use to solve the hardest problem.

My work at the LRDE consists in maintaining and adding new capacities to
Vaucanson. I take especially an interest in understanding and
programming new algorithms. This year, my particular purpose is to
extend Vaucanson to allow our users to solve problems and use
algorithms from the number theory.

Since January, the LRDE has recruited new students, so three new
students are working now on Vaucanson. An other part of my job at the
laboratory is to help them. With Guillaume Lazarra, we have to guide
them, and give them the basics to work on Vaucanson.
